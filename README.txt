# Image-Component Labeling (an Application of Breadth First and Depth First search)

I wrote this program for my JAVA_С class at Foothill College.

User enter the dimension. The image is always a square grid of pixels, min = 5x5 and max = 15x15 (default 10x10). The program generates an image of 1’s and 0’s. 

The user press the button "Label Components." The image components are labeled as discovered by the search algorithm. All pixels of the same component will have the same label and same random color. 

The upper part shows the result for Depth First search, the bottom part shows the result for Breath First search.
